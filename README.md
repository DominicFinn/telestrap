# Telestrap

This is a Bootstrap theme with a [Teletext-style font](http://www.fonts2u.com/teletext-regular-regular.font),
inspired by the text services we used to get before the Web and digital TV ruined everything.

It's pretty much just a novely project, so don't expect much support :)

## Usage

Install [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as you normally would, then add the theme CSS
(`dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css`). You'll find a bunch of examples in the repo.
